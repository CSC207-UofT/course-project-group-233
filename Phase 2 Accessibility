which features your program adhere to the principle.
Principle 1: Equitable Use

2. All users have the identical privacy protections by setting all users information as private attributes.
Therefore, Our program adheres the Equitable Use Principle.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
1. Since all functionalities are set to be public, users could choose which one and when to use.
2. Then, we add some notifications (such as register/login), users know where to click to use some functionalities.
3. Moreover, our program is based on clicking for interaction,
   both left- and right-handed users could use it without problem.
Thus, Our program adheres the Flexibility in Use Principle.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
1. Our program would give feedback (eg. success/failed) after they try to login/register.
   This helps users to understand which state they are in right now.
Possible Improvement:
We could add different language libraries into our program,
so that people not understanding English could also use our program.
Thus, Our program partially adheres the Simple and Intuitive Use Principle.
